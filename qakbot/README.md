## Qakbot Api Resolving

Ghidra script that resolves the structures used by Qakbot for obfuscating WINAPI calls.
Heavily inspired by this [script](https://github.com/0ffsetTrainingSolutions/QakbotTools/blob/b496a0f137094a1ff434761e7f04a228a7cdacf4/apiHashResolver.py) from @[0verfl0w_](https://twitter.com/0verfl0w_)
